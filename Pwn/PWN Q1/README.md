<!-- Remove this comment, and the '\' before '```' -->

Is there any way to get the flag? 




## Exploit

<!-- Much more detailed description than the following. -->
Use GDB to find the working of the program. Using gdb, the player will be able to find two comparisons in the program. The flag can be found by exploiting that.
<br />

<br />

The flag is:

\```
wtfCTF{y0u_f0und_th3_fl4g}
\```
