Mr F is starting a new company named FF.C0, an important and essential image file document is acting weird. He needs your help to help figure it out.
A flag maybe your reward!




## Exploit

<!-- Much more detailed description than the following. -->



The actual flag is in the `hint.jpg` file and the hint is in the `flag.jpg` file

Both the flag.jpg and hint.jpg is 1920x1080 in resolution
The player can see the flag in cipher form in the bottom right corner if he/she goes to the hex editor and changes the height and width of hint.jpg to that of flag.jpg(which is 1920x1080)
The place to change the hex code will be following the "FF C0" Marker identifier




<br />

The flag is: 



wtfctf{IHDR_h34d3r_w4s th3_k3y}
