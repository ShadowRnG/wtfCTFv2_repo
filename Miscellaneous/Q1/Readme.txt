### Forensics Question (using hex editor)

The actual flag is in the hint.jpg file and the hint is in the flag.jpg file

Both the flag.jpg and hint.jpg is 1920x1080 in resolution
The player can see the flag if he goes to the hex editor and changes the height and width of hint.jpg to that of flag.jpg
The place to change the hex code will be following the "FF C0" Marker identifier



--- More number of ciphered flag like texts can be added to the flag.jpg to distract the player and waste time. ---
